<p class="p1">As soon as you build an interesting application in backbone, one
  of the challenges you are likely to encounter is wanting to have composite
  views, or views that are contained within a larger view.  I&#8217;ve solved
  this problem several ways in different projects and I thought it would be fun
  to walk through the progression and how I&#8217;ve arrived at what I
  currently see as a preferred solution.  </p>
<p class="p1">Let&#8217;s start by talking about what might seem to be the most
  obvious solution and why it doesn&#8217;t actually work.  We&#8217;ll use as
  an example a view that displays a collection of people.  Let&#8217;s assume
  we&#8217;d like to have a view for the table and within it, views for each
  row.  You might end up with a TableView like so:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_view.coffee"></script>

<p class="p1">With the template for it being:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_view_template.haml"></script>

<p class="p2">I currently using haml_coffee as my favorite templating language.
   If you dig haml, it&#8217;s worth checking out.</p>
<p class="p2">Notice the tableRow method on TableView.  Because we pass the
  view itself into the template function, tableRow is available to us in the
  template.  In it we create a TableRow, render it, and then return it&#8217;s
  html.  Here&#8217;s what TableRowView and it&#8217;s template looks like</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_row_view_no_events.coffee"></script>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_row_view_template.haml"></script>

<p class="p2">And initially it all appears to work well.  We see our table with
  a row for each person.  Great!  But now let&#8217;s try adding an event
  handler that pops up an alert when we click a table cell.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_row_view_with_events.coffee"></script>

<p class="p1">And what happens?  Precisely nothing.  What&#8217;s going on?
   The problem is that the TableRowView&#8217;s element never actually gets
  added to the DOM.  We create a TableRowView in the tableRow method of
  TableView, render into it&#8217;s element, and then pull out the row view
  elements html and shove it into the rendered output of TableView.  We grabbed
  the html, but TableRowView&#8217;s element never actually made it into the
  DOM.  That means event binding, jQuery plugins, and all kinds of stuff just
  won&#8217;t work.  Not good.</p>
<p class="p1">Let&#8217;s try another approach:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_view2.coffee"></script>

<p class="p1">Here we&#8217;ve changed the tableRow method to not create the
  TableRowView at all, but instead to create a row element with an id.  We then
  add a second loop thru the collection at the end of render and create our
  TableRowView, passing in it&#8217;s element which we find using the id we
  gave it and then tell it to render.  Because the row view&#8217;s element is
  in the DOM at the time we create and render it, everything works.  When I
  first starting building complexish apps in backbone, this is how I generally
  did composite views.</p>
<p class="p1">But it&#8217;s pretty clunky.  We have a second loop thru the
  collection for one thing, and it just doesn&#8217;t feel very clean.  The
  code relating to adding rows is now in two different places, and the parent
  seems to have pretty intimate knowledge of how the child view works.</p>
<p class="p1">We can do better.  Backbone gives a powerful tool for decoupling
  in events, and we can use them here to make our code cleaner.  Let&#8217;s
  try another crack at TableView:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_view3.coffee"></script>

<p class="p1">As you can see, we&#8217;ve removed a good bit of code.
   We&#8217;ve gone back to creating our TableRowView in tableRow, but are now
  passing in reference to the TableView as a parentView property.  And we are
  no longer telling TableRowView when to render at all, instead we are
  broadcasting a &#8220;rendered&#8221; event that gives anyone who cares a
  chance to do whatever they need to do.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re also moving responsibility for when to render and
  what element to render into the TableRowView.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/superchris/2879204.js?file=table_row_view2.coffee"></script>

<p class="p1">It&#8217;s not necessarily less code overall, but the parent view
  is much less coupled to the child view.  The child view listens to the
  &#8220;rendered&#8221; event and then finds her element within the
  parent&#8217;s element.  And it seems to make sense for the child to do this,
  after all she is one best equipped to know how to locate her own element
  since she gave herself an id in the attributes method.  In case you
  haven&#8217;t seen this before, backbone will use tagName and attributes to
  build the element for a view if you don&#8217;t pass one in, which we
  don&#8217;t in the case of TableRowView.</p>
<p class="p1">The bit of this code that seems the least pleasant is the toHtml
  method.  This is an unfortunate hack to get the outerHtml for the element, as
  jQuery doesn&#8217;t seem to provide a more convenient way to do it.  Gentle
  reader, feel free to correct me if I&#8217;m wrong on this.</p>
<p class="p1">Overall though, I&#8217;m happier with this approach to composite
  views, so much so that I&#8217;ve extracted a lot of this into a base view
  class in my <a href="https://github.com/gaslight/backtastic"
    title="backtastic">backtastic</a> project.  I&#8217;ll get into lots more
  detail about backtastic in an upcoming post.</p>
