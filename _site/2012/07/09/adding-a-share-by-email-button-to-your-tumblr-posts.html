      <p>Apparently email is still a valid way of sharing things. It may still be the best way of sharing something with one person. Every social media app has an api for &#8220;share&#8221; buttons, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a whole lot of code out there to steal in the way of email sharing buttons. So if you have a Tumblr blog like this one, and can run some Ruby, steal this script if you like:</p>

<p><br/></p>

<div class="gist"><a href="https://gist.github.com/3074150.js?file=generate_email_button_html.rb">https://gist.github.com/3074150.js?file=generate_email_button_html.rb</a></div>

<p><br/></p>

<p>The output is html that you can paste into your custom Tumblr theme. An anchor tag, with a mailto action, that wraps a button image. You&#8217;ll need to replace the value of &#8220;image_url&#8221; in the script ( the one here is locked down by s3 ). The rest may work out just fine for you.</p>

<p>The email copy is uri-encoded and passed as the value to the &#8220;body&#8221; parameter in the mailto query string. The interface to the mailto scheme is pretty limited. I quit in my attempt to get any multipart html/text email stuff going on. The RFC states &#8220;The mailto URL is primarily intended for generation of short text messages that are actually the content of automatic processing (such as &#8220;subscribe&#8221; messages for mailing lists), not general MIME bodies.&#8221; So, yeah.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also pretty aware that I&#8217;m hacking the mailto scheme by putting a space where the &#8220;to&#8221; value should go. The idea is that an email client will pop up in a draft mode with the &#8220;to&#8221; field empty, so that the article sharer can fill it in. I got the result I wanted, but the execution seems shady.</p>

<p>Leave comments. I&#8217;m interested in better ways to do this, or ideas around how to acheive richer email messages from a share by email button.</p>
