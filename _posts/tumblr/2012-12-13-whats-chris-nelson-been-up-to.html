<p>Chris Nelson&#8217;s been busy!</p>

<p>In early November, Chris gave a talk at Ruby Conf &#8220;<a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1316-rubyconf2012-machine-learning-for-fun-and-profit-the-story-of-how-my-customer-wrote-my-code">Machine learning for fun and profit: the story of how my customer wrote my code</a>&#8221;. In it, Chris delves into decision trees, when they are appropriate tools, and their implementation in Ruby. In domains that implement overwhelming numbers of conditional rules that can be expressed as tabular data, decision tree algorithms can be utilized to determine outcomes instead of writing tons of conditional logic.</p>

<p>In late November, Elizabeth Naramore interviewed Chris on the Engine Yard Podcast, <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/podcast/gaslight-qcmerge-mastering-backbone">Cloud Out Loud</a>. Elizabeth and Chris talked about what we do at Gaslight and his <a href="http://www.masteringbackbone.com/">Mastering Backbone</a> training class. They talk about Chris&#8217;s latest open source project <a href="https://github.com/gaslight/backtastic">Backtastic</a>, which aims to make building forms in a Rails-backed Backbone app easier and more enjoyable. They talk about how the <a href="http://qcmerge.com/">QCMerge</a> conference, the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cincinnati-Web-Tech-Drinkup/">Web Tech Drinkup</a>, and <a href="http://gaslight.co/coffee">Gaslight Coffee</a> have revitalized the developer community in Cincinnati. Give it a listen if you&#8217;re interested in hearing details about what Chris has been working on, and the kinds of projects we&#8217;ve been working on at Gaslight!</p>

<p>Keep up the good work Chris!</p>
