title: The Correct Cucumber Regex for Matching Text in Quotes
tags:

<p>What&#8217;s the correct regular expression to use for matching text within quotes of a Cucumber step? I argue that It&#8217;s not the one suggested by Cucumber itself.</p>

<p>If I run a step missing step:</p>

<pre><code>When I click "Edit"
</code></pre>

<p>Cucumber will suggest:</p>

<pre><code data-language="ruby">When /^I click "(.*?)"$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
</code></pre>

<p>The practice for most is to copy that suggestion into their step definition file, and implement the step.</p>

<p>Often I&#8217;ve run into trouble when I&#8217;ve needed to create a slightly more specific version of that step in a succeeding test:</p>

<pre><code>When I click "Edit" for "Jack"
</code></pre>

<p>Running the step, I&#8217;ll get:</p>

<pre><code>no link or button 'Edit" for "Jack' found (Capybara::ElementNotFound) 
</code></pre>

<p>The regex defined in our initial step is a valid match for this step, unintentionally. The regex matches everything between a quote character, and the last quote character in the string. In this case &#8216;Edit&#8221; for &#8220;Jack&#8217;.</p>

<p>As proof, attempting to implement the new step using Cucumber&#8217;s recommended format yields:</p>

<pre><code>Ambiguous match of "I click "Edit" for "Jack"":
  features/step_definitions/running_stuff_steps.rb:12:in `/^I click "(.*?)"$/'
  features/step_definitions/running_stuff_steps.rb:16:in `/^I click "(.*?)" for "(.*?)"$/'
</code></pre>

<p>Both regexes are valid matches for that step.</p>

<p>So we need a regular expression to uniquely match each step. The problem regex says &#8220;match everything between the first and last quote characters&#8221;. We need it to say &#8220;match text between a quote and the next quote, regardless of where the end of the line is&#8221;. Or, in regular expression language, not this:</p>

<pre><code data-language="ruby">/^I click "(.*?)"$/
</code></pre>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code data-language="ruby">/^I click "([^"]*)"$/
</code></pre>

<p>This isn&#8217;t rocket science, but I&#8217;ve witnessed a few smart people scratching their heads on this one, not wanting to spend the mental energy to switch from whatever feature they are working on to dissect regular expressions.</p>

<p>Is there any good reason to default to the former over the latter? Is a pull request warranted?</p>
