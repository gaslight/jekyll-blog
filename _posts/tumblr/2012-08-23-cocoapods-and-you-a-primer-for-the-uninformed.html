<p>I&#8217;d been meaning to actually build something worthwhile with iOS since I
first heard about the SDK. A few months ago, we started work on a client
project that was going to start out life as a mobile web application and
evolve in to a native app. <a href="https://twitter.com/pkananen">Peter</a> was interested in the project and often
said that we would be able to deliver faster by just giving up and going
native. Since the app used quite a bit of GPS functionality, we decided to
give it a day and spike something out.</p>

<p>As a Rubyist, I&#8217;m a bit spoiled. A couple years ago, <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda">Carlhuda</a> began
working on a project that had a bit of a rough start but quickly became a
standard link in my toolchain. Of course I&#8217;m talking about <a href="http://gembundler.com">Bundler</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d heard about <a href="http://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a> and had experimented with iOS before, but never
taken the time to set things up and give it a try. On this spike, we gave it a
shot. There was a bit of fumbling at first, mostly because of my own ignorance
of linker flags and header search paths. Once we were set up, we were off and
running.</p>

<p>Our experience with CocoaPods has been pretty great. It takes care of much of
the &#8220;busy work&#8221; involved in using external libraries in your Xcode
applications. Recently, though, I&#8217;ve heard some iOS developers berate
CocoaPods, so I thought I&#8217;d take a few minutes and explain just how much
you&#8217;re getting for free when you &#8220;give up and use pods&#8221;.</p>

<h2>The Old Way</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ll use the quick and easy setup from <a href="https://twitter.com/samsoffes">Sam Soffes</a>&#8217; <a href="http://sstoolk.it">SSToolkit</a> page as a
reference. You can see that it isn&#8217;t trivial. Or quick. Or easy.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdmwebs.com/s/SSToolkit-20120822-231013.jpg" alt="sstoolkit_img"/></p>

<p>Nine steps. Nine! Before you get to do any of the fun stuff! Plus, now you&#8217;ve
downloaded old code. Want to update? Download the new zip, extract it, add the right
files (did they change? are there new files?), click Build and wait patiently
for the spinning wheel of death. Maybe not quite that drastic, but still more 
work than I&#8217;d like to do.</p>

<h4>Wait, wait! You can use&#8230;</h4>

<p>Yeah, I know. I can eliminate the download of the zip/tarball step with everyone&#8217;s
favorite: <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html">git submodules</a>!</p>

<p>I kid. Submodules have come a long way, too. They&#8217;re actually really awesome these 
days, but I <strong>still</strong> have to do all the stuff after I get the library on my
filesystem.</p>

<h2>The Better Way</h2>

<p>Now let&#8217;s do the same thing with CocoaPods. Keep in mind, though, that the
setup is a one-time cost. Once you&#8217;ve got a Podfile, adding a new library is
as easy as adding a new line and running <code>pod install</code>. If you&#8217;re the
screencast watching type, go no further than <a href="http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/5-cocoapods">NSScreencast</a> and watch right
now. That one&#8217;s free, but they&#8217;re well worth the subscription fee.</p>

<ol><li>First, install CocoaPods. If you&#8217;ve never messed with your Ruby
installation, it&#8217;s as easy as <code>sudo gem install cocoapods</code>. Shouldn&#8217;t take
too long.</li>
<li>Just this first time, run <code>pod setup</code> and CocoaPods will clone the spec
repo to a folder in your $HOME folder. Podspecs are the files CocoaPods
uses to learn how to find, install and configure libraries.</li>
<li><p>Next, create and edit a Podfile. It&#8217;s case sensitive, so make sure to call
it that. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll put in there:</p>

<pre>
    platform :ios
    xcodeproj 'MyProject.xcodeproj'

    pod 'SSToolkit'
</pre></li>
<li>That&#8217;s it. Run <code>pod install</code> and watch the magic. The first time you
install, CocoaPods will create a new Workspace that sets up your project
and the CocoaPods project properly. <strong>Make sure you open the Workspace file
going forward!</strong></li>
<li>Ready to update the code? As of now, you&#8217;ll have to delete the library you
want to update in the Pods folder and run <code>pod install</code> again. It <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/447">looks
like</a> we&#8217;re getting some <code>update</code> and <code>outdated</code> subcommands soon, 
though!</li>
</ol><p>Here&#8217;s what CocoaPods just did for you:</p>

<ul><li>Cloned the repo (or downloaded the zip archive) of SSToolkit.</li>
<li>Linked the Pods project to your existing app&#8217;s target.</li>
<li>Added the necessary files or directories to the Header Search Paths.</li>
<li>Using ARC and the library isn&#8217;t? That&#8217;s handled, too. -fno-objc-arc is set
on all the included library&#8217;s files!</li>
<li><strong>BONUS</strong>: If you&#8217;ve installed <a href="http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/">appledoc</a>, it&#8217;s <strong>generated documentation
from the library</strong> and it&#8217;s ready for you to search and use in Organizer!</li>
</ul><p>That&#8217;s quite a bit of awesome. Now go write all the code! If you&#8217;d like to
