</ul><p><span>To our delight, Steve Klabnik joins us on the second Gaslight podcast.  We learned about his passion for text-based adventure games at a young age and why &#8220;people problems&#8221; are more interesting than &#8220;technical problems&#8221; when developing software.  We also discuss how organizations can effectively use consensus discussion-making for a flatter structure. Finally Steve weighs in on the merits of Turbo Links and the need for measurable facts when talking performance.</span></p>
