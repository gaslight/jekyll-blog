<p>Fresh on the heels of <a href="http://qcmerge.com/">QC Merge</a> I found myself en route to Grand Rapids for the region&#8217;s best kept secret, at least as far as lean startups are concerned, the <a href="http://momentum-mi.com/events/lean-conference/">Michigan Lean Startup Conference</a> (MLSC). The second year conference is sponsored by <a href="http://momentum-mi.com/">Momentum</a>, a Michigan-based seed stage accelerator. New this year was a day of workshops taught by <a href="http://www.ashmaurya.com/">Ash Maurya</a>, <a href="http://market-by-numbers.com/">Brant Cooper</a>, and <a href="http://www.vlaskovits.com/">Patrick Vlaskovits</a>. In addition to the speakers, the event also offers regional entrepreneurs the ability to showcase their projects via lightening intros during breaks and at booths setup outside the conference room.</p>

<h2>Startup Luminaries</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/">Eric Ries</a> himself spoke at last year&#8217;s inaugural event. The highlight of this year&#8217;s event was <a href="http://steveblank.com/">Steve Blank</a>&#8217;s presentation given via Skype. Aside from Steve&#8217;s talk, my personal favorites were the presentations by Ash (as a fellow bootstrapper, I&#8217;m a big fan of Ash&#8217;s), App Sumo&#8217;s <a href="http://okdork.com/">Noah Kagan</a>, and veteran MLSC presenter, <a href="http://www.danmartell.com/">Dan Martell</a> who was to speak in-person but also presented via Skype due to a travel snafu.</p>

<p>With luminairies like these it&#8217;s a mystery to me why this event is attracting primarily western Michigan attendees. The only exception I encountered was Bloomington-based entrepreneur <a href="http://nicktippmann.com/">Nick Tippmann</a> who I had met at <a href="http://brandery.org/">The Brandery</a>&#8217;s Office Hours a few weeks ago. I&#8217;d estimate there were about 200 attendees, about 30 of which attended the workshops the following day. The general consensus of the presentations was very positive, matching the energy level I sensed at last year&#8217;s event, and the workshops were equally we received.</p>

<h2>Just Like Last Year, Only Better!</h2>

<p>One contrast of significance from last year&#8217;s event was the caliber of entrepreneurs with whom I spoke. It seemed last year that the wantrepreneurs were everywhere. This year, everyone I spoke with seemed to have drunk the lean startup Kool-aid. This appraisal was born out not only by the appearance of &#8220;all the right words&#8221; in conversations but in-depth examinations during the workshops. Without exception, everyone I spoke to was proud to discuss the experiments they had run and the learning which resulted. What&#8217;s more, there wasn&#8217;t a stealth startup to be found.</p>

<h2>Bonus Material</h2>

<p>My weekend in Grand Rapids did not end there. Saturday the folks at <a href="http://atomicobject.com/">Atomic Object</a> hosted &#8220;User Experience for Lean Startups&#8221; presented by <a href="http://www.lanehalley.com/">Lane Halley</a> from <a href="http://luxr.co/">LUXr</a>. My main take aways from this workshop are to not underestimate the impact of visual learning (thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/agilous/status/203854790302777344">clothespin man</a>!), and personas are powerful tools that serve both to flesh out facts about your product&#8217;s users and provide a concrete focal point for the product team.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m extremely envious of the MLSC and wish there was a similarly focused event here in Ohio. Fortunately, it&#8217;s not a long drive to Grand Rapids, even from my corner of the Buckeye state, and the commute takes me out of the local startup eco-system and offers an opportunity to share experiences and ideas with leaders from another. Kudos to the MLSC team for hosting a very informative event and hope to see you again next year.</p>
